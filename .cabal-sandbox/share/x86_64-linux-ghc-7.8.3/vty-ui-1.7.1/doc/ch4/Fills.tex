\section{Fills}

The \fw{Fills} module provides space-filling widgets which can be used
to add ``flexible'' space to control layout.  Fixed-size widgets often
need flexible space to fill the terminal, so we use ``fill'' widgets
to do this.

There are two types of fills:

\begin{itemize}
\item Horizontal, created by the \fw{hFill} function.  \fw{hFill}
  takes a fill character and a height and fills available space with
  that character using the current attribute settings.
\item Vertical, created by the \fw{vFill} function.  \fw{vFill} takes
  a fill character and fills available space with that character using
  the current attribute settings.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Growth Policy}

\fw{HFill}s always grow horizontally but not vertically.  \fw{VFill}s
always grow vertically but not horizontally.
