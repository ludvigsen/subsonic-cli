\chapter{Guided Tour of Built-In \vtyui\ Widgets}
\label{chap:guided_tour}

\vtyui\ provides a broad set of widgets for controlling layout,
presenting text, and interacting with the user.  In this chapter we'll
cover these built-in widgets and their APIs at a high level.  With
this knowledge you should be able to bring them together to build rich
interfaces.  As always, consult the API documentation for some of the
finer details.

Naturally, we may not be able to provide meaningful examples expressed
purely in terms of a single widget type and may need to mention other
widgets; in those cases, see the relevant sections.
